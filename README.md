# Bash Scripts

This is a collection of Bash scripts that I use daily on Linux. I hope you can take some inspiration from them. Comments and pull requests are welcome.

Please note that you may need to tweak certain variables to tailor the scripts to your specific needs. For detailed configuration information and a list of required dependencies, be sure to check the README files associated with each script.

All scripts have a .sh extension for clarity. 

I have not tested them on other systems capable of running Bash, such as Mac OS.
