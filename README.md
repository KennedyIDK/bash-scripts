# Bash Scripts

I hope you can take some inspiration from the scripts in this repository. Comments and pull requests are welcome.

I have given scripts a .sh extension for clarity, but I personally prefer to omit the extension when running them.

Scripts were written for personal use on Linux. They may work on Mac OS systems using Bash, but I have not tested them.

Configuration variables are listed at the top of each script. You may need to modify these variables to suit your needs.

See individual script README for more information and required dependencies.
